<p> Welcome to my webpage! After graduating the University of Washingtons' Fullstack Coding Bootcamp,
    I decided to create a page that houses my current projects and a discussion page for javascript libraries and frameworks I have learned or, am currently learning.

    Since I graduated highschool, there were a lot of  different kinds of educational/carrer paths I was interested in but, could never decide what would really bring out 
    my passions. I spent the first several years just trying to figure out this thing called life as most young audlts do.

    My boyfriend and I, with the encouragement of his mom, decided to pack up our life and move to Seattle.

After another few years of adujusting to a new life,new city, I spent my time working in Property Management.
I was already well aware that customer service and property management was not something I wanted to still be doing 5 years later but still, the question of where do I want to be 
instead, haunted me. One thing that stayed consistent through the several years I worked in property management was, the constant conversations regarding web development with my residents.
Several residents took the time to chat with me regarding their day to days and programs I could enroll in to get started.
Now I never thought I would be drawn to the tech industry but, one day I decided to work on some codeacademny challenges and, the successful output of the code made my heart flutter.
A feeling I never felt when doing property management or, studying kinesiology and nutrition in my free time.

    As you can imagine, this lit the fire I needed to move forward with a proper education. After weeks of research, I enrolled in UW's Coding bootcamp and 8 months later:

    Here we are.
